* `earth_mover`: originally started off as experiments playing around with the earth mover's distance
(due to its applicability in ordinal problems), but then evolved into my ICML submission where we look
at enforcing unimodality constraints on the probability distribution of ordinal problems. The EMD loss
is one of the losses tested with this unimodal constraint.
